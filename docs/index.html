                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Physical HCI is all about combining the physicial world with the digital world. Something is not necessarily "tangible" just because you physically interact with it. You interact with a mouse and keyboard, but does that make a laptop an instance of physical HCI? Not exactly. </p>

                <p>Much of this work is inspired by Hiroshi Ishii (a very stylish name for a very stylsh computer scientist). Hiroshii is known for his work on Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) that blend the physical and digital worlds. Hiroshi's "Tangible Bits" and "Radical Atoms" projects are both worth checking out to get some background on why experiments like this are valuable.</p>
